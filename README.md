# Description

My motivation to start this project is to gain more experience for my career.


## Installation

-Initiation-

When I started this project, my goal was to create a portfolio so that I could be more "visible" to the companies around me.

-Planning-

I planned to reduce job search time, using a website I can show my performance.

-Execution-

For my plan to work, I have to work calmly and not try to do everything myself.

# Usage

In the first part of the page we have the header, with the photo, my name and three more links.

Below is some information about me.

Below are three photos of my work that are also links, I didn't have any other important work so I put the links to the same page.

Below my work, there's my contacts.

At the end of the page we have a footer.
